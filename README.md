# Network Simulator

Implementing a Network Simulator Project for CS 143.

## Components
###1. Hosts:  
+ End points of a network. 

###2. Routers:

+ Route packets through the network.

###3. Links:  
+ Connect hosts and routers.
	
	 	
###4.Packets :   
+ Units of data that are sent through the network
+ Since we are implementing a TCP protocol, the packets follow TCP packet regulation:
+ The TCP headers are:
+ 1) Source Port: 16bits
+ 2) Destination Port: 16 bits
+ 3) Sequence Number: 32 bits
+ 4) Acknoweledgement Number: 32 bits
 
 
 
###5.Flows :
+ Represent data being sent from one host to another"# Network-Simulator"
